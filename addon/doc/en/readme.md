Although this application is relatively well accessible, this extension attempts to improve the accessibility of the Recuva file recovery software by:

* naming certain unlabeled objects,
* preventing unnecessary focus from being placed on unknown objects,
* adding the script "KEY_Search_RESULT" to re-read the overall result of the search,
* automatically maximizing the window displaying the search result.


This extension has been tested with version 1.53 of Recuva.
